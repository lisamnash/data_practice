#The counted
Here I am playing with some data from a dataset found on kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/the-guardian/the-counted)

## In this directory
### File: `exploration`
This notebook just goes through some basic exploration of the data.  I make some histograms and maps and do some other descriptive things.

### File: `population`
I think that some of the things I'll look at above in the exploration phase will be more informative if we normalize by state population.  In this notebook I extract some population data and put it in the right format to use above.
